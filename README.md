# NumSolStochDiffEq
I am working through Numerical Solution of Stochastic Differential Equations by Kloeden and Platen.
There are many programming and traditional exercises in the book. I haven't quite decided on an 
implementation langauge yet, but I'm leaning towards C++ and maybe even some Scheme since I'm also doing SICP.
The non programming exercises I will try to leave the answers in either markdown or LaTeX.
